My 1st knitr Document
=================================

This is some "text chunk"

Here is a R code chunk:
```{r}
set.seed(1)
x<-rnorm(100)
mean(x)
```

To compilate Python chunks, 1st you must use the Reticulate library:

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

Now, you may use Python

```{python}
import numpy as np
import math

a = np.log2(8)
print(a)
print(math.pi)
```
