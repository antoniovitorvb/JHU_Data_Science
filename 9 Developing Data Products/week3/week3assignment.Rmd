```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
library(plotly)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(2016-07-21)

df <- data.frame(dtime = 1:100,
                 temperature = rnorm(n = 100, mean = 30, sd = 5),
                 pressure = rnorm(100))
```

## Pressure x Temperature x Time

```{r}
plot_ly(data = df,
        x = ~temperature,
        y = ~pressure,
        z = ~dtime,
        type = "scatter3d",
        mode = "markers",
        color = ~temperature)
```

## Thanks
