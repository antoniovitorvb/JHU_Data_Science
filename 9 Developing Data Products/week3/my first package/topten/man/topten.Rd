\title{Building a model with top ten features}
\usage{
topten(x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a n x p matrix of n observations and p predictors}

\item{y}{a vector of length n representing the response}
}
\value{
a vector of coefficients from the final fitted model with top 10 features
}
\description{
This function develops a prediction algorithm based on the top 10 features
in 'x' that are most predictive of 'y'
}
\details{
This function runs a univariate regression of y on each predictor in x and
calculates a p-value indicating the significance of the association, The final
set of 10 predictores is taken from the 10 smallest p-values
